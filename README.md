# FooshyRLdev2025
This is the repository of my project for [/r/roguelikedev's annual Tutorial Tuesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/1luh8og/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/). I'll come up with a funky title for this project sometime.

This project will be developed in Godot 4.5 beta 3, mostly basing on [SelinaDev's Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial for Godot 4.1](https://selinadev.github.io/05-rogueliketutorial-01/) (can't believe it's already 2 years old haha) with some personal touches of mine.

## Current progress as of 16/07/2025
Finished parts 1 out of 13. Working on Part 2.

## Credits
### Tools used
- **Godot Engine 4.5 beta 3**: Thanks Juan. For making one of the best new game engines for the new decade.
- **Aseprite**: Will keep using it fortnite (not the game, i meant FORTH NIGHT) forever.
- **SFXR**: Some of the older original sounds i made were done from this neat app.
- **CTone**: This tool is derived from one of Daisuke Amaya's earlier sound making tools he developed for Cave Story and it's amazing. The newer original sound effects are made on this.
### Articles
- **SelinaDev**: For the amazing adaptation of the Python tutorial in Godot.
### Assets
#### Graphics
- **FooshyHuk**: I made the boy player sprite.
- **PiiiXL**: https://piiixl.itch.io/1-bit-patterns-and-tiles for the wall tiles. (CC BY 4.0)
#### Sounds
### Special thanks
- **/r/roguelikedev**: My inspiration for getting (back) into roguelikes was because of how traditional roguelikes look so interesting to look at due to their high focus on worldbuilding and D&D inspired RPG gameplay. But also their friendly encouragement on developing me inspired me to keep learning Godot in this way.
