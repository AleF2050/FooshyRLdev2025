# FooshyRLdev2025
 Repository for my project for the /r/roguelikedev annual Tutorial Tuesday. There's going to be some funky and random jittery stuff since i wanted to take on creating an outsider themed Roguelike in the same vein as modern and odd JRPGs such as EarthBound, Undertale and Deltarune.

 I'll come up with a funky title for this project sometime.

 This project will be developed in Godot 4.5 beta 3, mostly basing on [SelinaDev's Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial for Godot 4.1](https://selinadev.github.io/05-rogueliketutorial-01/) (can't believe it's already 2 years old haha) with some personal touches of mine. I originally wanted to follow the Python tutorial but my sheer lack of practise with Python led me to play safe by taking on the Godot tutorial. There's chances this project may be dropped depending on how i'm performing with it or just when i feel like it so wish me luck.
